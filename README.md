My copy of Snake Vs Block

The finished game. A copy of Snake Vs Block.

Everything in it is the same as in the original game.

Key features:
  1. Selection and purchase of skins for coins.
  2. Getting coins for the length of the snake at the end of the level.
  3. Skin customization.
  4. Collisions with obstacles, spawns particles. Destroying obstacles also spawns particles. They are different.
Also, every time health is taken away, the color of the block changes.
  5. All colors (blocks, snakes, background, text, level progress bars) can be configured in the level settings.
  6. Saving progress (levels, length of a snake, coins).
  7. All parameters of the level (strength of blocks, their number, amount of food) can be configured in the level settings.
